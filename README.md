# Keybind Companion

## Intro

An HTML5 app for easily showing / recalling the keybinds you've set up for your games.

## Setup

The following tools are expected to be installed globally:

- [SASS][1]
- [npm][2]
- bower, `npm install -g bower`

When global installs are (already) done, the following will suffice:

- `npm install`

*In case of weird errors in node, first attempt to re-install above mentioned tools and try again, if that doesn't help, search the tickets before posting a new one, Thank You!*

## Development

While developing I recommend running grunt watch. In case that's not yet configured, well,
oops ;)
